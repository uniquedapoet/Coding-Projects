Project Setup:

Create the project directory structure with subdirectories for app, models, routes, and data.

Environment Setup:

Set up a virtual environment.
Install FastAPI, Pydantic, and Uvicorn.

Dataset Integration:

Obtain and place the dataset containing information on tracks and drivers in the data directory.
Decide on the format (e.g., CSV, JSON) and structure of the dataset.

Define Pydantic Models:

Create Pydantic models for Track and Driver based on the dataset schema.

Create Main Application File:

Set up the main FastAPI application file to initialize the app and include root routes.

Create Routes for Tracks and Drivers:

Create route files to handle API requests for tracks and drivers.
Implement functions to read data from the dataset and return it in response to API requests.

Integrate Routes with Main Application:

Include the tracks and drivers routes in the main application.
Implement Data Loading Logic:

Write functions to load data from the dataset into memory when the application starts.
Ensure data is accessible by the routes.

Run the Application:

Use Uvicorn to run the FastAPI application locally for testing and development.

Extend API Functionality:

Add endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting track and driver information.
Implement validation and error handling for API requests.

Add Race Information:

Define a Race model based on the new dataset structure.
Create routes to handle race information and integrate them with tracks and drivers.

Testing:

Write unit tests for the API endpoints to ensure correctness and reliability.
Use testing tools like FastAPI's testing client or pytest.

Documentation:

Leverage FastAPI's automatic documentation features (Swagger UI and Redoc) for interactive API documentation.
Document the API endpoints, request/response formats, and data models.

Deployment Preparation:

Prepare the application for deployment by configuring environment variables and dependencies.
Choose a deployment platform (e.g., Heroku, AWS, DigitalOcean) and set up the necessary infrastructure.

Deployment:

Deploy the API to the chosen platform.
Test the deployed application to ensure it is functioning correctly in the production environment.

Future Enhancements:

Plan for adding more complex features, such as race results, historical data, and advanced querying capabilities.
Continuously improve the API based on user feedback and performance metrics.
